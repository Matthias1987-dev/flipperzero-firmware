# applications_user
This is my test folder applications_user for testing some Apps for the Flipper-Zero.

My Main Projekt was mad_test_button_panel_on_off.
I change the Projekt Name to SubGhzRemote

I try a new structure for the menu.
In the moment i copy the skeleton_app from https://github.com/jamisonderek/flipper-zero-tutorials/tree/main/ui/skeleton_app

Thanks to Jamison Derek.
